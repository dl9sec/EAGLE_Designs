  <dt>ESP32VGAv2 (License CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</dt>
  <dd>An ESP-32 DevKitC base board with 6-bit VGA, DAC sound output and PS/2 keyboard connector. The design can be used with FabGL by fdivitto (https://github.com/fdivitto/FabGL) and with ESP32Lib by bitluni (https://github.com/bitluni/ESP32Lib). The folder contains a ready-to-use ZIP-archive with Gerber/Excellon data which can be directly used at JLCPCB.com.</dd>
  <dt>ESP32-XTonUINO/ESP32-XTonUINO_Buttons (License GPL-3.0-only)</dt>
  <dd>An ESP-32 DevKitC base board which can be used for a TonUINO player (e.g. with adapted sources of CKUL's TonUINO-ESP project at https://github.com/CKUL/TonUINO-ESP32 or one of its forks). The base design is extended by capacitive touch buttons and a relay which can be used e.g. for a door opener. The design uses a module for charging a LiPo/LiIon recharchable battery and a boost converter module to supply the board from the battery. The folder contains ready-to-use ZIP-archives with Gerber/Excellon data which can be directly used at JLCPCB.com.</dd>
  <dt>JLCPCB_CAMjob (License MIT)</dt>
  <dd>A CAM job to generate the Gerber/EXCELLON data for JLCPCB.com in one pass (ZIP the generated files before upload!).</dd>
